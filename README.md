- Can we understand whether/how a healthy natural environment modulates the spread of COVID-19? And whether changed human behaviours are having an impact on this? Can we use this insight to improve health outcomes? 
- Evidence-based support for decision-makers and individuals to mitigate their environmental impact and reduce their personal health risk. 

Can we understand from landscape structure and function, the impact of natural capital and ecosystem services on how a healthy natural environment modulates the spread of COVID-19, and what benefits we obtain from this that may lead to better COVID-19 related health outcomes? For instance, do diverse ecosystems suppress disease outbreaks?  What characteristics of the natural environment modulates the disease dynamics? Is there evidence that exposure to nature/biodiversity lead to better health outcomes? How can we provide evidence-based support for individuals to allow them to mitigate their environmental impact and also reduce their personal health risk at the same time? 

# The Report

## Introduction
Complex interactions between humans, animals and the environment play a critical role in the appearance of new viruses.  Approximately 75% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic and exposure to these diseases is amplified via overexploitation of ecosystem services to the point of one new infectious human disease every four months (Everard et al., 2020). UNEP (2020) concluded that exponential population growth and decline in biodiversity and ecosystems has increased opportunities for pathogen transmission. 

Coronavirus, a member of the Coronaviridae family is one of the primary pathogens targeting the human respiratory system (Rothan & Byrareddy 2020). Symptoms range from that of the common cold, to lethal respiratory syndromes (Carducci et al., 2020). In the last 18 years, coronaviruses have caused three major outbreaks: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In December 2019, a cluster of patients were epidemiologically linked to a wet animal and seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and symptoms were described to the WHO as “pneumonia with unknown aetiology” (Rothan & Byrareddy 2020).  The virus (later named SARS-CoV2) began to spread globally through human-to-human transmission and on the 11th March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As of the 30th of June 2020, there were 10,471,015 cases and 509,742 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).  

Global efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 include strict quarantines, social distancing measures and enforcements, travel bans and restrictions, and closure of workplaces, schools, shops and other public places. These measures inadvertently produced some temporary environmental benefits including a reduction in consumption and transport, equating to a four to seven percent decline in annual global carbon dioxide emissions (Le Queré et al 2020). Moving forward in a post COVID-19 world it is critical to recognise the value of ecosystems and their services on a global and local scale. These unprecedented circumstances present a unique opportunity to understand the value of ecosystems in “lockdown” conditions. Healthy ecosystems regulate disease transfer, provide clean air and water whilst simultaneously improving wellbeing (Fisher et al., 2009)

### Health and wellbeing associated with green and blue spaces  

The population of the UK are increasingly inhabiting towns and cities, with over 80% of the population currently living in urban areas (DEFRA, 2020). However, nearly a third (31%) of the urban extent in the UK is urban “green space” (ONS 2018). Green spaces include areas of natural land cover, such as parks, cemeteries, sports fields, golf courses and nature reserves. They may be accessible to all or restricted access, but the term does not generally include private gardens.  These areas provide a variety of ecosystem services, such as removal of air pollution, flood protection and physical and mental health benefits (Jennings & Gaither, 2015; Niemelä et al., 2010). 

Mental and physical health benefits from green spaces have been widely reported (Lee et al., 2015; Maller et al., 2005; Maund et al., 2019; Nutsford et al., 2016; Romagosa, Eagles & Lemieux, 2015). These are driven by the availability of space for physical activities, social interaction, connection to nature and the promotion of mental relaxation (Irvine et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015; Nutsford et al., 2016; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Völker & Kistemann, 2013; White et al., 2013). For example, in some instances green space availability and accessibility is seen to lead to increased physical activity levels (Coombes, Jones & Hillsdon, 2010; Lachowycz et al., 2012; White et al., 2018). Environmental quality has also been seen to be associated with psychological restoration associated with green spaces, suggesting that higher value areas for nature are more beneficial for human wellbeing (Ratcliffe, Gatersleben & Sowden, 2013; Wyles et al., 2017). 

### COVID-19 and green spaces  

This interaction between green spaces with health in the context of a pandemic is particularly stark, both from a health and wellbeing perspective. For example, there evidence suggests the presence of green space reduces the prevalence of obesity in the population (Lachowycz & Jones, 2011). Considering that conditions such as obesity have been seen to contribute to increased COVID-19 hospital admissions and mortality there could be some cause to argue the value for green spaces has increased due to COVID-19 (Docherty et al., 2020; Sattar et al., 2020).   

Green space availability takes on more importance for urban dwellers, those from ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic status. One in eight British households does not have access to a private garden, and this proportion rises to one in five if you live in London, and one in three if you are Black (ONS 2020). However, 72% of the UK population have access to a public park within a fifteen-minute walk, and parks are more accessible in poorer areas (ONS 2020).  
 
When social distancing is considered, the importance of availability of these spaces is heightened. For example, if each urban resident was to visit their nearest park for an hour across an 8-hour window, 89% parks could have the potential to facilitate safe social distancing (Shoari et al., 2020). In some areas, increased use of green spaces has been recorded throughout the pandemic, which has the potential to add pressure on these areas (Venter et al., 2020). Managing the increased necessity for green spaces for public use, combined with the need for social distancing has led to difficult decisions for land managers and policy makers, with park closures seen in some areas (Freeman & Eykelbosh, 2020).   

Social distancing measures in place to slow COVID-19 transmission have the potential to impact public health and wellbeing (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020; Torales et al., 2020). For example, social isolation due to social distancing could promote symptoms such as of post-traumatic stress (Brooks et al., 2020). Green spaces provide opportunities for people to spend time outdoors, connect with nature, exercise and socialise, potentially mitigating in part the mental and physical tolls of lockdowns.  The positive effects on well-being while allowing for social distancing highlight the importance of these spaces, both during the current period and into the future (Samuelsson et al., 2020). Here we hypothesise that areas in the UK with more green space have lower rates of Covid-19 infection because areas with more green space provide opportunities to spend time safely outdoors, potentially leading to more compliance with lockdowns and social distancing guidance.
