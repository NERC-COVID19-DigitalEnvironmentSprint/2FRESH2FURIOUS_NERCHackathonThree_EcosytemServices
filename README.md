# Executive Summary 


# The brief

This report is an entry to the [COVID-19 Hackathon 3: Ecosystem Services] (https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/covid-19-hackathon-3-ecosystem-services/) COVID-19 Hackathon 3: Ecosystem Services, organised by the Natural Environment Research Council on behalf of the UKRI.  The brief: 

- Can we understand whether/how a healthy natural environment modulates the spread of COVID-19? And whether changed human behaviours are having an impact on this? Can we use this insight to improve health outcomes? 
- Evidence-based support for decision-makers and individuals to mitigate their environmental impact and reduce their personal health risk. 

Can we understand from landscape structure and function, the impact of natural capital and ecosystem services on how a healthy natural environment modulates the spread of COVID-19, and what benefits we obtain from this that may lead to better COVID-19 related health outcomes? For instance, do diverse ecosystems suppress disease outbreaks?  What characteristics of the natural environment modulates the disease dynamics? Is there evidence that exposure to nature/biodiversity lead to better health outcomes? How can we provide evidence-based support for individuals to allow them to mitigate their environmental impact and also reduce their personal health risk at the same time? 

# The Entry Report

## Introduction

Complex interactions between humans, animals and the environment play a critical role in the appearance of new viruses.  Approximately 75% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic and exposure to these diseases is amplified via overexploitation of ecosystem services to the point of one new infectious human disease every four months (Everard et al., 2020). UNEP (2020) concluded that exponential population growth and decline in biodiversity and ecosystems has increased opportunities for pathogen transmission.
